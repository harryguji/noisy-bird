### Description
A side-scrolling game in a cave setting where the player dodges incoming randomly scaled speleothems. The character's vertical movement is controlled by using the spacebar. The player dies when hitting the ground or speleothems. The player gets a point whenever a set of obstacles is dodged. JavaFX was used to make this project.
